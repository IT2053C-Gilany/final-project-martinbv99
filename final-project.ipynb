If not, then compare it to the next question where I want to see what leads to higher average viewers. I also want to see if there are any outliers. \n",

    "Is there more watch time on longer or shorter streams?\n",

    " I would want to do another scatter plot, with the X being stream in minutes and the Y being watch time in minutes. That way we can see if there is a positive correlation between the 2. \n",

    "What language dominates the TOP 1000?\n",
    "\n",
    " I would want to do a piechart for this question as there might be multiple languages and there needs to be a way to see how much of the TOP 1000 those langauges take up. Or if one language is dominating the whole thing. \n",

    "How many of the TOP 1000 are mature? \n",
